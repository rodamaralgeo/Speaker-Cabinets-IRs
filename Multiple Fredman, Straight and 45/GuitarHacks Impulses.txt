Centre - Straight on dead centre

Between - Straight on between Cnetre and edge of Dustcap

Edge - Straight on Edge of Dustcap

Fredman Straight - same as Centre

Fredman Angled - 45 degrees next to Fredman straight mic

*****45 is 45 degree angled at Centre, Between or Edge, eg, off-axis.  The 45 degree are all against cloth with the closest edge of the mic.  Can't be bothered doing 45's at different distances from the cloth.

-5 is 5mm away from cloth
-10 is 10mm away from cloth
-20 is 20mm away from cloth
These go for Straight and Angled.  For Angled, the measurement is from closest angled edge of mic to cloth.


Enjoy
